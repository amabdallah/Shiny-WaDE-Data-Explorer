# Shiny-WaDE-Data-Explorer
A simple data exploratory tool, built using R and Shiny.

This tool is being developed to help demonstrate the utility of sharing data via WaDE. 
Goals include:
- facilitating data summarization
- enabling quick comparisons of water use (for instance, by water use type (e.g. agricultural or municipal/industrial))
